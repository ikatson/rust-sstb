# TODO ([x] means done)
- [ ] open-source
  - [ ] write README with badges
  - [ ] Travis tests etc
- [ ] range queries
- [ ] bloom filters on disk
  - [ ] can be written with mmap probably, into a separate file
- [ ] writing "flush_every"'s default should depend on the default compression.
- [ ] read cache size configurable both for page cache and for uncompressed cache
- [ ] read cache size should be in bytes, not blocks
- [ ] cache cannot be explicitly disabled in some places
- [ ] add length to encoded bits
- [ ] indexes as separate files
  in this case don't need to maintain the index in memory while writing
- [ ] remove as much as possible unsafe and unwrap
  - [ ] Mmap can be put into an Arc, to remove unsafe static buffer casts. This should not matter at runtime.
- [ ] the index can store the number of items and uncompressed length (in case the file is compressed)
  - the uncompressed length can be used when allocating memory for uncompressed chunks
  - the number of items in the chunk can be used for HashMap capacity IF we get back the "Block" structure which helps not scan the whole table every time.
  - there's a space tradeoff here, so maybe it's all not worth it
- [ ] consider getting back the "Block" trait and its implementations
  - this will help not scan through the chunk on each get()
  - however, there are costs
    - need to allocate HashMaps for lookups
      - if length is not known, might even reallocate
    - messes up the concurrency as the hashmap becomes the contention point
      - an RWLock might help for the majority of the cases
  - even if all this is implemented, it's totally not guaranteed that it's going to be faster in the end.
- [x] u32 keys and values, not u64
- [x] mmap with no compression is already multi-threaded, but the API does not
  reflect that
- [x] zlib bounded and unbounded performs the same in benchmarks
- [x] analyze all casts from u64 to usize
  - [x] clippy actually has a lint for it in pedantic
- [x] multi-threading
- [x] compression is all over the place
- [x] files and imports are all over the place, reorganize
- [x] fail if keys or values are too long (> u32_max)
- [x] byte keys
  - [x] also "memchr" is very slow, better to use offsets
